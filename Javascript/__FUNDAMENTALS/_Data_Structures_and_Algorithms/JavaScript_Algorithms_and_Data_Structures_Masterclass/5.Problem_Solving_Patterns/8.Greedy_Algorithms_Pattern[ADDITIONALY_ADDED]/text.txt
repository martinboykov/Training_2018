Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit.
In contrer to Dynamic programming, Greedy algorithm does not reconsider its choises.

Target Problems: OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS
  -> Find min or max result with specific condition (constraint)
  / Get min cost to travel from A to B (the time must be less than 12hrs)/
     --> Feasable solutions - All solutions that fit the condition
     --> Optimal solutions - Best solution that fits the condition (only one)
